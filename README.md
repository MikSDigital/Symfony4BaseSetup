# Symfony4BaseSetup

A base setup of Symfony4 + easyadmin + fosuserbundle

# What is it?

Basically it is a fresh symfony 4 clone with easyadmin and fosuserbundle configured.

As most of the applications I develop use this as a base, I decided to preconfigure it.

# How do I install?

1. Clone the repository to where you want to create your project
2. Run composer install
3. copy the `.env.dist` file to `.env` and update the info
4. run database creation and migration
